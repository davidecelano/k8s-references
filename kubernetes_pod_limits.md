# Capacity Management and Overcommitment in OpenShift

This document summarizes best practices for managing capacity and overcommitment in Red Hat OpenShift, based on the article from Red Hat's blog.[1]

## Core Concepts

### Pod Requests and Limits
- **Pod Request**: The minimum amount of CPU/memory guaranteed for a pod. This ensures the pod has the necessary resources to start and run.[1]
- **Pod Limit**: The maximum amount of CPU/memory a pod can consume. This prevents a single pod from starving other pods of resources.[1]

### Overcommitment
Overcommitment occurs when a pod's resource limits are set higher than its requests. This allows for more efficient use of cluster resources by letting pods burst and use available, unallocated resources when needed.[1]

## Best Practices for Resource Allocation

- **Always set requests and limits**: Failing to do so can lead to unpredictable performance and potential resource starvation for other applications on the node.[1]
- **Set requests based on monitoring**: Analyze your workload's average usage over time to determine appropriate request values.[1]
- **Avoid setting CPU limits**: CPU is a compressible resource, and setting a limit can lead to unnecessary throttling. It's often better to let workloads use spare CPU cycles.[1]
- **Use a scale factor for memory limits**: Set memory limits to a reasonable multiple of the memory request to allow for bursts without risking Out Of Memory (OOM) kills.[1]

## Tools for Automation and Optimization

OpenShift provides several tools to help automate and optimize resource management:

- **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**: Automatically adjusts pod CPU and memory requests based on actual usage. It is recommended to run VPA in "Recommendation" mode initially to avoid unexpected pod restarts.[1]
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Scales the number of pod replicas up or down based on metrics like CPU utilization.[1]
- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Automatically adds or removes nodes from the cluster based on overall resource demand.[1]
- **ClusterResourceOverride (CRO) Operator**: Allows administrators to enforce cluster-wide resource allocation policies by overriding the requests and limits of pods.[1]
- **OpenShift Scheduler & Descheduler**: The scheduler can be profiled to distribute pods evenly, while the descheduler can evict pods to optimize placement and enforce affinity rules over time.[1]

## Red Hat Management Tools

- **Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) Right Sizing**: Provides CPU and memory recommendations at the namespace level to help platform engineers optimize resource allocation.[1]
- **Red Hat Insights Cost Management**: A SaaS tool that offers container-level recommendations to optimize for either cost savings or performance, based on historical usage data.[1]

# Kubernetes CPU Limit Best Practices

This section summarizes the key points from the article "Kubernetes CPU Limits: Best Practices for Optimal Performance" on PerfectScale.io.[2]

## The Misconception
A common piece of advice for Kubernetes beginners is to set CPU limits to prevent a single container from monopolizing CPU resources.[2] However, it's CPU *requests* that guarantee a minimum amount of CPU for a workload, while CPU *limits* cap the maximum usage.[2]

## How CPU Limits Work
Kubernetes uses CGroup parameters `cpu.cfs_period_us` (the CPU period, usually 100ms) and `cpu.cfs_quota_us` (the amount of CPU time a container can use in that period) to enforce limits.[2] When a container exceeds its CPU quota, it is "throttled" and must wait for the next CPU period to continue processing.[2] This can severely impact the performance of multi-threaded applications, which consume their quota much faster.[2]

## Drawbacks of CPU Limits
- **Wasted Resources**: CPU limits prevent containers from using idle CPU resources on a node, leading to underutilization and wasted capacity.[2]
- **Performance Degradation**: Throttling can cause significant performance issues, especially for multi-threaded applications, as they spend time waiting for the next CPU cycle instead of processing.[2]
- **Ineffective for "Noisy Neighbors"**: Limits are not an effective way to prevent one container from negatively impacting others; CPU requests are better for ensuring fair resource distribution.[2]

## When to Use CPU Limits
While generally not recommended for performance-critical environments, CPU limits can be useful in specific scenarios:
- **Staging Environments**: To test application behavior under worst-case, resource-constrained conditions.[2]
- **Consistent Performance**: For organizations where predictable performance is a higher priority than optimal resource utilization.[2]

## Best Practices
1.  **Set CPU Requests Appropriately**: CPU requests should reflect the relative importance and expected usage of each container to ensure they get the resources they need.[2]
2.  **Consider Concurrency**: Do not set CPU requests higher than the number of concurrent threads the application can use.[2]
3.  **Avoid CPU Limits for Performance**: If performance is the primary goal, avoid setting CPU limits to allow workloads to take advantage of available idle CPU.[2]

# For the Love of God, Stop Using CPU Limits on Kubernetes

This section summarizes the key points from the article "For the Love of God, Stop Using CPU Limits on Kubernetes" on robusta.dev.[3]

## Why You Shouldn't Use CPU Limits on Kubernetes

The article argues that setting CPU limits in Kubernetes is an anti-pattern that often causes more harm than good.[3]

*   **CPU Limits Cause Throttling**: When a pod hits its CPU limit, it is throttled, even if there are unused CPU resources available on the node. This means your application's performance is artificially degraded for no reason.[3]
*   **CPU is a Renewable Resource**: CPU is not "used up." If a pod uses a lot of CPU one moment, it doesn't impact the CPU available in the next moment. Throttling a pod that needs a temporary CPU burst is inefficient.[3]

## The Right Way: Use CPU Requests

Instead of limits, you should use CPU requests to manage your resources effectively.[3]

*   **CPU Requests Guarantee Resources**: Kubernetes guarantees that a pod will receive the amount of CPU it requests. This prevents other pods from causing CPU starvation for your application.[3]
*   **Requests Allow for Bursts**: Without limits, pods can use any excess CPU available on the node beyond their requested amount. This allows applications to handle unexpected spikes in traffic or workload without being throttled.[3]

## Best Practices Summary

*   **CPU**:
    *   **Always** set accurate CPU requests for your containers.[3]
    *   **Do not** use CPU limits.[3]
*   **Memory**:
    *   The advice for CPU does **not** apply to memory, which is a non-compressible resource.[3]
    *   **Always** set both memory requests and memory limits.[3]
    *   It is recommended to set memory requests equal to memory limits.[3]

The article also mentions an open-source tool, **Kubernetes Resource Recommender (KRR)**, which can help you determine appropriate resource requests based on historical usage data.[3]

# The importance of getting resource requests and limits right

The article discusses the importance of correctly setting resource requests and limits for containers in Kubernetes and OpenShift.[1] It highlights a real-world scenario where a customer's cluster experienced stability issues due to misconfigured resource settings, leading to cascading node failures.[1]

The key takeaways are:

*   **OOM Killer:** The Linux kernel's Out Of Memory (OOM) killer terminates processes when the system is low on memory. In OpenShift, this mechanism is used to terminate containers that exceed their memory limits.[1]
*   **Scheduling:** Kubernetes schedules pods based on their resource *requests*, not their *limits*. The kernel on the node enforces the limits.[1]
*   **Elastic vs. Non-Elastic Resources:** CPU is an "elastic" resource that can be throttled, while memory is a "non-elastic" resource that is finite.[1]
*   **Oversubscription:** When pods use significantly more resources than they request, it can lead to node oversubscription. This can cause instability, as the scheduler might place more pods on a node than it can handle, leading to OOM events and potential node failures.[1]
*   **Mitigation:** To prevent these issues, the article recommends:
    *   Educating developers on the importance of setting accurate resource requests and limits.[1]
    *   Using quotas to enforce a `maxLimitRequestRatio`.[1]
    *   Analyzing pod specs in CI/CD pipelines to detect and warn about excessive request-to-limit ratios.[1]
    *   Aiming for a request-to-limit ratio as close to 1.0 as possible.[1]
    *   Treating the request as the pod's normal usage and the limit as a safety net.[1]

# Kubernetes CPU Throttling

Kubernetes CPU throttling is a process that restricts the amount of CPU available to containers to prevent the system from crashing due to CPU resource exhaustion.[1] This can negatively impact performance, so it's important to manage CPU resources effectively.[1] You can set CPU limits and requests to control the minimum and maximum CPU a workload can consume.[1] Monitoring for CPU throttling is also crucial, and can be done with third-party tools or by observing high CPU utilization.[1] Best practices to avoid throttling include setting appropriate requests and limits, using Quality of Service (QoS) classes to prioritize workloads, and implementing autoscaling.[1]

# Rightsizing Kubernetes Workloads

Rightsizing Kubernetes workloads is crucial for optimizing resource utilization and controlling costs.[1] Many organizations waste resources by over-provisioning, as containers often use far less CPU and memory than they request.[1] The Kubernetes scheduler allocates resources based on these requests, not actual usage, which can lead to significant inefficiencies and higher cloud bills.[1]

To rightsize effectively, start by benchmarking new services to establish a conservative initial resource estimate, then monitor and adjust.[1] For existing workloads, use historical data and tools like the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) to refine resource requests based on actual consumption patterns, such as p95 usage metrics.[1] It is also important to differentiate between CPU and memory limits: it is often better to avoid setting CPU limits to prevent unnecessary throttling, while memory limits should be set to match requests to ensure pod stability and avoid out-of-memory errors.[1]

# Kubernetes CPU Requests and Limits: A Deep Dive

This article provides a deep dive into Kubernetes CPU requests and limits.[1] It explains how CPU requests guarantee a minimum amount of CPU time for a container and are used by the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) to proportionally allocate CPU resources during contention.[1] The article also covers CPU limits, which enforce a hard cap on CPU usage, and discusses when to set them, such as for benchmarking or in multi-tenant environments.[1] It further explores the CPU Manager's static policy, which allows for pinning containers to specific CPU cores for performance-sensitive workloads.[1] Finally, it highlights key metrics to monitor for debugging CPU-related issues, like `container.cpu.throttled` and `container.cpu.limit`.[1]

# CPU Requests and Limits in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, CPU requests and limits are used to manage CPU resources. CPU requests guarantee a minimum amount of CPU for a container, which the scheduler uses to place pods on appropriate nodes.[1] CPU limits, on the other hand, enforce a maximum amount of CPU that a container can use.[1] While setting limits seems intuitive for stability, it can lead to inefficient resource utilization.[1] If a pod hits its CPU limit, it will be throttled even if there are idle CPU resources on the node, wasting available capacity.[1] Therefore, it is often better to only set CPU requests to ensure fair resource allocation and allow pods to utilize any available idle CPU, which maintains stability without sacrificing performance.[1]

# Kubernetes Limits: Mastering CPU and Memory Constraints

The article "Kubernetes Limits: Mastering CPU and Memory Constraints" explains how Kubernetes limits can be used to manage CPU and memory resources for containers.[1] While these limits can help ensure predictable resource allocation, they can also negatively impact applications with variable workloads.[1] The author suggests that a thorough understanding of an application's resource consumption is crucial before setting limits, and that in some cases, especially with CPU, it may be better to avoid them.[1] The article also discusses the role of "requests" in guaranteeing minimum resources and cautions that autoscaling is not a complete solution for improperly configured limits.[1]

# Kubernetes CPU Limits and Throttling

In Kubernetes, you can manage container CPU resources using requests and limits.[1] CPU requests define the minimum CPU a container needs, which Kubernetes uses to schedule pods on appropriate nodes.[1] CPU limits, on the other hand, set the maximum CPU a container can use, and exceeding this limit leads to CPU throttling, where the container's performance is slowed down.[1]

While setting CPU limits can prevent containers from monopolizing resources and causing instability, it can also lead to resource underutilization and performance bottlenecks if not configured correctly.[1] It is recommended to set CPU limits in multi-tenant environments or when predictable performance is crucial, but only after benchmarking your application's needs.[1]
