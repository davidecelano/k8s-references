# System Patterns: Documentation Architecture

## Document Architecture

### Structure Pattern
The comprehensive guide follows a **progressive disclosure pattern**:

```
Executive Summary → Fundamentals → Specific Technologies → Advanced Topics → Implementation
```

This allows both quick reference and deep learning paths.

### Content Organization Principles

#### 1. Evidence-Based Layering
- **Claims supported by sources**: Every recommendation links to authoritative documentation
- **Controversial topics addressed head-on**: CPU limits debate resolved with multiple sources
- **Implementation examples follow theory**: Practical YAML follows conceptual explanations

#### 2. Comprehensive Coverage Model
- **Horizontal coverage**: All major resource types (CPU, memory, storage, extended)
- **Vertical depth**: From basic concepts to advanced implementation patterns
- **Temporal scope**: Current features + emerging capabilities + future considerations

#### 3. Implementation-Ready Structure
- **Conceptual explanation**: What and why
- **Technical details**: How it works
- **Practical examples**: Copy-paste YAML configurations
- **Monitoring guidance**: How to observe and validate
- **Troubleshooting**: How to debug issues

## Research Methodology Pattern

### Source Validation Hierarchy
1. **Official Kubernetes Documentation**: Primary authoritative source
2. **Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals (KEPs)**: For emerging features
3. **Official GitHub Repositories**: For implementation details and limitations
4. **Cloud Provider Documentation**: For production patterns and best practices
5. **Industry Expert Sources**: For validated real-world insights

### Adversarial Testing Process
```
Initial Research → Document Creation → Source Validation → Accuracy Verification → Final Review
```

This ensures all recommendations can withstand scrutiny and are implementation-ready.

## Content Design Patterns

### Controversial Topic Resolution
When addressing disputed topics (like CPU limits):
1. **Acknowledge the controversy**
2. **Present multiple perspectives**
3. **Provide authoritative sources**
4. **Make evidence-based recommendation**
5. **Include implementation guidance**

### Feature Maturity Handling
- **GA Features**: Full implementation guidance with production examples
- **Beta Features**: Clear version requirements with implementation notes
- **Alpha Features**: Mentioned with strong stability warnings
- **Future Features**: Noted without speculation

### Example Integration Pattern
Every major concept includes:
- **Basic example**: Minimal working configuration
- **Production example**: Real-world ready configuration
- **Monitoring integration**: How to observe the configuration
- **Common variations**: Alternative patterns for different use cases

## Documentation Maintenance Patterns

### Version Tracking
- **Kubernetes version compatibility**: Clear feature-to-version mapping
- **Document versioning**: Track major updates and changes
- **Source freshness**: Regular validation against current documentation

### Update Triggers
- **Kubernetes releases**: Review for new features and changes
- **KEP progression**: Track enhancement proposals through maturity stages
- **Community feedback**: Incorporate insights from implementation experience
- **Tool evolution**: Update for new monitoring and management tools

### Content Evolution Strategy
- **Additive updates**: New sections for new features
- **Refinement updates**: Improved examples and clarifications
- **Validation updates**: Regular source verification and accuracy checks
- **Structure updates**: Reorganization for improved usability
