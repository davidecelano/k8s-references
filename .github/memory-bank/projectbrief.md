# Project Brief: Kubernetes Resource Management Research

**Project:** Comprehensive Kubernetes Resource Management Documentation  
**Created:** September 6, 2025  
**Type:** Research & Documentation Project  

## Core Mission

Create authoritative, research-based documentation on Kubernetes pod resource management that synthesizes current best practices, emerging features, and real-world implementation guidance.

## Project Scope

### Primary Goals
1. **Comprehensive Research**: Gather and validate current best practices for Kubernetes resource management
2. **Authoritative Documentation**: Create a definitive guide covering CPU, memory, and emerging resource management patterns
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Provide practical examples, monitoring strategies, and troubleshooting approaches
4. **Future-Ready Insights**: Document emerging features like pod-level resource specifications (K8s 1.34+)

### Key Deliverables
- Comprehensive research document covering all aspects of Kubernetes resource management
- Evidence-based recommendations for CPU and memory management
- Implementation examples with YAML configurations
- Monitoring and troubleshooting guidance
- Best practices documentation

### Success Criteria
- Document accuracy validated against official Kubernetes sources
- Practical examples that can be directly implemented
- Clear guidance on controversial topics (e.g., CPU limits debate)
- Coverage of latest features and emerging capabilities

## Context

This project emerged from the need to create authoritative guidance on Kubernetes resource management, addressing common misconceptions and providing validated best practices. The documentation consolidates research from official Kubernetes documentation, industry experts, and real-world implementation patterns.

## Constraints

- Must be technically accurate and validated against current Kubernetes versions
- Should address controversial topics with evidence-based recommendations
- Must be implementation-ready with practical examples
- Should cover both current and emerging capabilities

## Key Decisions

1. **Research-First Approach**: All recommendations must be validated against authoritative sources
2. **Practical Focus**: Include implementation examples and real-world guidance
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Address all major aspects of resource management
4. **Future-Aware**: Include emerging features and future considerations
