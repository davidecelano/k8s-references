# TASK001 - Research Kubernetes Resource Management Best Practices

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** September 6, 2025  
**Updated:** September 6, 2025

## Original Request
Research and document comprehensive best practices for Kubernetes pod resource management, addressing CPU limits, memory management, and emerging features.

## Thought Process
The task required extensive research across multiple authoritative sources to create evidence-based guidance on controversial topics like CPU limits. The approach focused on:

1. **Comprehensive source gathering** - Official Kubernetes docs, KEPs, GitHub repositories
2. **Controversial topic resolution** - Address CPU limits debate with evidence
3. **Emerging feature coverage** - Include pod-level resources and new capabilities
4. **Implementation focus** - Provide practical, copy-paste examples

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Gather authoritative sources from official Kubernetes documentation
- [x] Research controversial topics (CPU limits) across multiple sources  
- [x] Document emerging features (pod-level resources, VPA evolution)
- [x] Create comprehensive coverage of all resource types
- [x] Include practical implementation examples

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
