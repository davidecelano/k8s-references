# TASK004 - Apply Memory Bank Structure for Project Documentation

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** September 6, 2025  
**Updated:** September 6, 2025

## Original Request
Apply the memory bank instructions to create comprehensive project documentation structure that preserves all research insights, decisions, and patterns for future reference.

## Thought Process
The memory bank structure was essential to capture all the research insights, technical decisions, and implementation patterns discovered during this project. This documentation serves as:

1. **Project foundation** - Core mission and scope definition
2. **Context preservation** - Why decisions were made and how they evolved
3. **Pattern documentation** - Reusable approaches for future projects
4. **Technical knowledge** - Tools, technologies, and constraints
5. **Progress tracking** - Complete task history and achievements

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Create memory-bank directory structure
- [x] Document project brief with core mission and scope
- [x] Capture product context and user experience goals
- [x] Record active context and current work state
- [x] Document system patterns and architecture decisions
- [x] Capture technical context and tool ecosystem
- [x] Track progress and achievements
- [x] Create tasks folder with complete task history
- [x] Document all completed tasks with full context

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
