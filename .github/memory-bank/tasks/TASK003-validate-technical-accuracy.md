# TASK003 - Validate Technical Accuracy Through Adversarial Testing

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** September 6, 2025  
**Updated:** September 6, 2025

## Original Request
Perform adversarial testing of the comprehensive documentation to validate all technical claims and recommendations against authoritative sources.

## Thought Process
Adversarial testing was critical to ensure the document could withstand scrutiny and be trusted for production use. The approach involved:

1. **Source validation** - Check every major claim against official documentation
2. **Controversial topic verification** - Validate disputed recommendations (CPU limits)
3. **Emerging feature accuracy** - Confirm beta feature details against KEPs
4. **Implementation testing** - Verify YAML examples and configurations
5. **Cross-reference validation** - Ensure consistency across multiple sources

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Validate pod-level resource specifications against KEP 2837
- [x] Verify CPU limits guidance against multiple authoritative sources
- [x] Confirm VPA limitations against official repository
- [x] Check Prometheus metrics and queries for accuracy
- [x] Validate Kubernetes version requirements
- [x] Verify cgroups v2 requirements and capabilities
- [x] Confirm QoS class behavior documentation

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
