# TASK002 - Create Comprehensive Documentation Guide

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** September 6, 2025  
**Updated:** September 6, 2025

## Original Request
Create a comprehensive documentation guide that synthesizes research into an authoritative, implementation-ready resource for Kubernetes resource management.

## Thought Process
The documentation needed to serve multiple audiences (platform engineers, DevOps teams, SREs) while providing both quick reference and deep learning paths. The structure followed progressive disclosure principles:

1. **Executive summary** for quick decisions
2. **Fundamental concepts** for learning foundation  
3. **Specific technologies** for deep implementation
4. **Advanced topics** for specialized scenarios
5. **Implementation guidance** for practical deployment

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Create document structure with progressive complexity
- [x] Write executive summary with key findings
- [x] Document fundamental concepts and terminology
- [x] Create detailed sections for CPU and memory management
- [x] Cover emerging features (pod-level resources)
- [x] Include autoscaling and optimization strategies
- [x] Add monitoring and observability guidance
- [x] Provide security and governance coverage
- [x] Create implementation guidelines and examples
- [x] Build comprehensive troubleshooting guide

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
