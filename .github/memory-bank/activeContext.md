# Active Context: Current Work State

**Last Updated:** September 6, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Research Validation & Documentation Complete

## Current Work Focus

### Recently Completed
- ✅ **Comprehensive Research Document Created**: 15,000+ word authoritative guide completed
- ✅ **Adversarial Validation Performed**: All major recommendations validated against official sources
- ✅ **Technical Accuracy Confirmed**: Document validated against Kubernetes 1.34, KEP 2837, VPA limitations
- ✅ **Implementation Examples Included**: YAML configurations, Prometheus queries, monitoring strategies

### Current Status
The comprehensive Kubernetes resource management guide is **COMPLETE** and **VALIDATED**. The document successfully:

- Provides evidence-based guidance on controversial topics (CPU limits)
- Covers emerging features (pod-level resources in K8s 1.34 beta)
- Includes practical implementation examples
- Offers comprehensive monitoring and troubleshooting guidance
- Addresses all major aspects of resource management

## Recent Changes

### Document Structure Finalized
- **15 major sections** covering all aspects of resource management
- **Executive summary** with key findings
- **Progressive organization** from fundamentals to advanced topics
- **Implementation guidelines** with practical examples
- **Troubleshooting guide** for common issues

### Key Recommendations Validated
- **CPU limits approach**: "Avoid CPU limits" recommendation validated against multiple authoritative sources
- **Memory management**: "Always set both requests and limits" confirmed
- **Pod-level resources**: K8s 1.34 beta feature accurately documented via KEP 2837
- **VPA limitations**: Accurately documented from official VPA repository

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Memory Bank Creation**: Establish project documentation structure for future work
2. **Knowledge Preservation**: Document all research insights and patterns discovered
3. **Process Documentation**: Capture research and validation methodology used

### Future Considerations
- Monitor Kubernetes 1.34 GA release for pod-level resource updates
- Track VPA evolution and integration with pod-level resources
- Update document as new features mature and best practices evolve

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Controversial Topic Handling
- **CPU limits**: Took strong stance against CPU limits based on multiple authoritative sources
- **Memory equality**: Recommended requests = limits for most scenarios
- **Evidence requirement**: All recommendations backed by official documentation or authoritative sources

### Feature Coverage Strategy
- **Current capabilities**: Focused on production-ready features
- **Emerging features**: Included beta features (pod-level resources) with clear version requirements
- **Future evolution**: Noted areas of active development without speculation

### Documentation Philosophy
- **Implementation-focused**: Every concept includes practical examples
- **Source-validated**: All guidance traceable to authoritative sources
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Single document covering all major aspects
- **Maintenance-ready**: Structure supports future updates and evolution
