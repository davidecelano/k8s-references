# Product Context: Kubernetes Resource Management Guide

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Kubernetes resource management is one of the most critical yet misunderstood aspects of container orchestration. Common issues include:

- **Misconceptions about CPU limits**: Many practitioners still believe CPU limits are essential, despite evidence they cause performance degradation
- **Memory management confusion**: Unclear guidance on when to set requests vs limits for memory
- **Emerging feature awareness**: New capabilities like pod-level resources (K8s 1.34+) are not well understood
- **Implementation gaps**: Lack of practical, validated examples for real-world scenarios
- **Monitoring blind spots**: Insufficient guidance on observability and troubleshooting

### The Impact
Poor resource management leads to:
- **Performance degradation** from unnecessary CPU throttling
- **Cluster instability** from memory overcommitment
- **Cost inefficiency** from resource over-provisioning
- **Operational complexity** from inadequate monitoring
- **Scaling challenges** from misconfigured autoscaling
